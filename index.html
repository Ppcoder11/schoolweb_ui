        <div class="about"><h2>‘The Future Of The Nation Is Getting Scripted In The Schools’.</h2>
            A vibrant classroom gives way to a resurgent nation. Modern Vidya Niketan Aravali Hills was founded in 2000 by Sh. Gopal Sharma, an educationist, a pioneer & a visionary who aspired to provide insightful education with world-class facilities.
            
            Here, at MVN, Aravali Hills, modernity meets traditions, with a firm belief in character formation, ethos, moral values, and attention to spiritual, intellectual, and social development.

            Sprawling across acres of lush green valley, the Aravali’s heart, the institution is hailed as an architectural marvel incorporating the latest infrastructure.
